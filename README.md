Implementation of basic data preprocessing tasks using python libraries.

### Why Data Pre â€“ Processing is important?
Data preprocessing is a data mining technique that involves transforming raw data into an understandable 
format. Real-world data is often incomplete, inconsistent, and or lacking in certain behaviors or trends, and 
is likely to contain many errors. Data preprocessing is a proven method of resolving such issues. Data 
preprocessing prepares raw data for further processing.


- Incomplete: lacking attribute values, lacking certain attributes of interest, or containing only aggregate data
- Noisy: containing errors or outliers
- Inconsistent: containing discrepancies in codes or names


### Data Preprocessing Tasks
- Data Cleaning - Fill in missing values, smooth noisy data, identify or remove outliers and noisy data, and resolve inconsistencies
- Data integration - Integrate data with multiple databases or files.
- Data transformation - Data normalization and aggregation
- Data reduction - Data reduction in volume but produces the same or similar analytical results
- Data discretization - (for numerical data)

### Steps of code implemntation.
1.  Import the dataset and libraries
2.  Explore the dataset
3.  Removing irrelevant columns
4.  Handling missing data
5.  Formatting data
6. Dealing with categorical Data
7. Visualization
